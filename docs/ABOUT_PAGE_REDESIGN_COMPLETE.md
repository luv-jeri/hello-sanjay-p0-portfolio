## Design Principles Applied

### Typography Hierarchy
- **Display headings**: 3xl → 8xl (responsive)
- **Section headings**: 3xl → 4xl
- **Body text**: Base → lg
- **Metadata**: sm
- Font weight variations for contrast
- Gradient text treatments for emphasis

### Spacing & Rhythm
- Consistent vertical spacing (py-16 → py-24)
- Generous white space between sections
- Maximum content width: 5xl (1024px)
- Responsive padding adjustments

### Color Strategy
- **Primary gradients**: Primary → Violet → Indigo
- **Warm gradients**: Amber → Orange → Red
- **Cool gradients**: Green → Emerald → Teal
- Subtle opacity levels (5%, 10%, 20%)
- Muted backgrounds for elegance

### Motion & Animation
- **Framer Motion** for complex animations
- **BlurFade** for section entrances
- Staggered reveals for lists
- Hover interactions (scale, shadow, translate)
- Respects user motion preferences

### Composition
- Alternating layouts prevent monotony
- Grid variations (1, 2, 3 columns)
- Decorative elements (gradient bars, orbs)
- Ambient background blurs
- Asymmetric balance
