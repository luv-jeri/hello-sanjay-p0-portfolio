## 🎨 Design System Integration

### Typography Scale
```
Hero Heading:    text-5xl → text-8xl  (bold, gradient)
Category Titles: text-4xl → text-5xl  (bold)
Section Titles:  text-4xl → text-6xl  (bold)
Body:            text-base → text-lg  (normal)
Quote:           text-2xl → text-4xl  (light italic)
```

### Color Palette
```
Primary Accent:   violet-500
Category Dividers:
  - Frontend:     blue-500
  - Backend:      green-500
  - Cloud:        violet-500
  - Other:        orange-500
Background Gradients:
  - indigo-500/5
  - violet-500/5
  - cyan-500/5
```

### Spacing System
```
Section Padding:  py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-32
Section Gaps:     space-y-24 md:space-y-32
Grid Gaps:        gap-8 md:gap-16
Card Gaps:        gap-12
```

## 🎭 Animation System

### Entry Animations (BlurFade)
```typescript
delay={0.1}  // Hero
delay={0.3}  // Skills
delay={0.5}  // Competencies
delay={0.6}  // Quote
```

### Scroll-Triggered Animations
```typescript
whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-100px" }}
```

### Stagger Effects
```typescript
// Skill items
delay: skillIdx * 0.05  // 50ms between items

// Competencies
delay: idx * 0.1        // 100ms between cards
```

### Hover Interactions
```typescript
// Skill items
- Border: border/30 → primary/60
- Dot: scale(1) → scale(1.5), primary/40 → primary

// Competency badges
- Scale: 1 → 1.1
- Background: primary/10 → primary/20
```

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Design Insights
1. **Typography > Containers:** Proper typographic hierarchy eliminates need for visual frames
2. **Editorial Layouts Scale:** Two-column split works beautifully across all screen sizes
3. **Subtle Wins:** Small hover effects (border, dot) more effective than flashy animations
4. **Consistency Matters:** Matching design language across pages creates professional cohesion

### Technical Insights
1. **Client Components:** Motion requires 'use client' — plan component boundaries accordingly
2. **Framer Motion:** Stagger effects + scroll triggers create sophisticated feel with minimal code
3. **Progressive Blur:** Subtle radial blur (0.2 intensity) adds depth without overwhelming
4. **CSS Grid:** `grid-cols-[1fr_2fr]` creates perfect editorial layout ratio

### Process Insights
1. **Reference Other Pages:** Study existing designs (About, Experience) for consistency
2. **Typography First:** Start with text hierarchy before adding visual elements
3. **Iterate on Motion:** Start simple, add complexity only where it enhances UX
4. **Document Everything:** Comprehensive docs save future time and clarify decisions

## 👥 Stakeholder Summary

### For Developers
**What changed:** Replaced card-based layout with typographic editorial design. All skills now displayed in clean list format with hover effects. Competencies use numbered badges in 3-column grid.

**What to maintain:** Update `constants.ts` for skills, `copy.ts` for descriptions. Animation timing in component if needed.

**What to watch:** Performance on lower-end devices, ensure animations remain smooth.

### For Designers
**Design system:** Typography-first editorial layout matching About/Experience/Projects. Muted gradient backgrounds, subtle category-specific accent colors, minimal decorative chrome.

**Brand consistency:** Violet accent color, serif quotation marks, numbered competency badges all consistent with portfolio identity.

**Future direction:** Consider extending editorial layout to Services and Contact pages.

### For Product
**User impact:** More scannable skill presentation, professional appearance aligns with senior-level positioning. Hover interactions encourage exploration.

**Metrics to track:** Time on page, scroll depth, CTA click-through rate.

**A/B test opportunity:** Compare conversion rates vs. old card layout.
