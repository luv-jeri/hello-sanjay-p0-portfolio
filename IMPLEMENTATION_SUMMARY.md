## 🛡️ Security Features Explained

### 1. **Honeypot Field**
- Hidden field named "honeypot" in both forms
- Humans can't see it (CSS hidden + tabindex=-1)
- Bots often fill it out automatically
- If filled, submission is silently rejected

### 2. **Time-Based Check**
- Forms track when page loads
- Submissions faster than 2 seconds are rejected
- Prevents rapid bot submissions
- Real users take longer to fill forms

### 3. **Input Sanitization**
- All text inputs are sanitized on the server
- Removes HTML tags: `<script>`, `<img>`, etc.
- Prevents XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks
- Uses regex: `.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '')`

### 4. **Server-Side Validation**
- All validation happens on the server (API routes)
- Client-side validation is only for UX
- Never trust client-side data
- Email regex validation on server

### 5. **Environment Variables**
- API keys stored in `.env.local` (gitignored)
- Never exposed to browser/client
- Only accessible in server-side code
- Different keys for dev/staging/production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Emails not being sent

**Check:**
1. Is `RESEND_API_KEY` set correctly in `.env.local`?
2. Did you restart the dev server after adding the API key?
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Check terminal/server logs for errors
5. Log in to Resend dashboard and check "Emails" section
6. Check spam folder (sometimes emails land there initially)

### Issue: API route not found (404)

**Check:**
1. Files exist at:
   - `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`
   - `src/app/api/schedule-call/route.ts`
2. Restart dev server
3. Check for TypeScript errors

### Issue: Rate limit exceeded

**Solution:**
- Free tier has 100 emails/day limit
- Check Resend dashboard for usage
- Upgrade to paid plan if needed
- For testing, you can create multiple test accounts

### Issue: Emails go to spam

**Solution:**
1. Set up domain verification in Resend
2. Add SPF, DKIM, DMARC records to your domain
3. Avoid spammy words in emails
4. Include unsubscribe link (for newsletters)
5. Warm up new domain gradually

## 🎓 How It Works (Technical Deep Dive)

### Contact Form Flow:
1. User fills form on `/contact` page
2. Client-side validation runs (instant feedback)
3. On submit, React sends POST to `/api/contact`
4. Server validates data (honeypot, timing, fields)
5. Server sanitizes all inputs
6. Server calls Resend API with email data
7. Resend sends HTML email to your Gmail
8. Server returns success/error to client
9. Client shows success message and resets form

### Schedule Call Flow:
Same as above, but:
- POST to `/api/schedule-call`
- Different email template (pink gradient)
- Includes phone and preferred time fields
- Subject is "Schedule a Call Request"

### Email Delivery:
```
Your Portfolio → Resend API → Email Servers → Gmail → Your Inbox
   (Browser)     (Server)      (Cloud)         (ISP)    (You)
```
